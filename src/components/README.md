## Components Overview

The `components` directory contains reusable React components that are utilized across various parts of the application. Here's a quick review of the key components:

- **Button.jsx**: A customizable button component that handles click events. It supports passing a className for styling and children for content.
  
- **Label.jsx**: A simple component that wraps text or other elements within a `<p>` tag. It allows for consistent styling of text labels throughout the app.

- **IconButton.jsx**: A composite component that combines an SVG icon with a button. It allows for interactive buttons with icons and optional tooltips.

- **Image.jsx**: A wrapper around an image element (`<img>`), providing a consistent way to apply styling to images across the app.

- **Modal.jsx**: A modal dialog component that can display content over the main UI. It handles opening and closing based on a prop (`isOpen`).

- **NavBarLink.jsx**: A link component specifically styled for the navigation bar, supporting custom class names and child elements.

- **ProductCard.jsx**: A component that displays information about a product or event, including an image, title, description, and action buttons.

- **ReviewCard.jsx**: A card component that displays individual reviews, including details like the review title, content, and associated metadata like date and category.

- **Search.jsx**: A search component that includes input fields and buttons, designed to help users filter through data such as guides, events, or reviews.

- **ToggleButton.jsx**: A toggle switch component that allows users to switch between two states, often used for theme toggling (e.g., dark mode).
